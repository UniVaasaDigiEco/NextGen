### *NextGen ‚Äì The Future of Food Waste-Reducing Buffet Dining*

**NextGen** was a research and development project coordinated by the [University of Vaasa](https://www.uwasa.fi/en/tutkimus/hankkeet/nextgen) between **April 2023 ‚Äì March 2025**.  
The project successfully developed and piloted a **digital predictive model** for monitoring and reducing food waste in the **Horeca (hotel, restaurant, caf√©)** industry.

## üéØ Objectives
- Develop, pilot, and demonstrate a **tailored predictive model** for food waste management.  
- Co-create **new operational and behavioural methods** with Horeca staff and customers to encourage sustainable practices.  
- Utilize the **VME Lab** (Virtual, Mixed, and Extended Reality Environment) at the University of Vaasa for practical demonstrations and usability testing.  
- Strengthen the ongoing **Waste Insight** research theme focusing on data-driven food waste reduction.

## ü§ù Partners & Collaboration
The project involved collaboration with several regional and national partners, including:
- Kuortaneen Urheiluopisto Restaurants  
- SmartKitchen  
- Into Sein√§joki Oy  
- Green Key Oy  
- Sein√§joki University of Applied Sciences  
- University of Turku  
- Arts University  
- Regional development associations in Ostrobothnia and South Ostrobothnia  

## üì¶ Project Results
- A **working prototype** of a digital predictive model for food waste monitoring.  
- **Co-created operational practices** to reduce waste generation in the Horeca sector.  
- **Public resources, data, and tools** developed during the project are released here for reuse, research, and further development.

## üí° Legacy
NextGen has successfully concluded, leaving behind practical methods and digital tools to help businesses and researchers combat food waste through data-driven insight and collaborative innovation.
